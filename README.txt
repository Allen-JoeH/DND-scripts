EncounterRating produces a rating from 'Trivial' to 'Deadly' based on party level and challenge of monsters.

InitOrder allows the ordering of all monsters and characters in an encounter by initiave, as well as generating initiave for multiple monsters of same type.

Travel allows calculation of either distance of time based on input params, and allows creation of a travel summary from which further info can be determined.

TODO:
Separate file for monster statblocks as objects, which can then be used in functions rather than creating manually.
